# Requirements
- this is working for **windows** (tested on win 11). 
- python (not python 2)

# Features
- Python script that updates :
    - bun
    - pnpm
    - pip
    - deno

- extensible, you can add more things to update or remove things.

# Extra
- If you want to make this script run automatically, then use **task Scheduler** (find from start menu) or go to run and type `taskschd.msc`
    - I personally run this script manually only because if something in my machine starts acting up weird then I can pinpoint the problem to updating these softwares. If it were to update in the background and something major in my system breaks, it would take me longer to debug.
